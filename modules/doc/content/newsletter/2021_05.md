## Weighted Gap Mortar Mechanical Contact Implementation

We have implemented a variationally consistent discretization scheme for the
zero-penetration mechanical contact constraints. Interested readers may refer to
the associated [issue](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/16961) and
[pull request](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/17189).

## Post-processors Usable in Initial Conditions

We added [/PostprocessorInterface.md] to initial conditions. Post-processor
values can now be retrieved using `getPostprocessorValue()` and `getPostprocessorValueByName()`,
and these post-processors will be executed before the initial condition as long
as their `execute_on` parameters include `INITIAL`.

## SQA Updates

We have updated the document governing our software quality practices. The changes have resulted
in a few more required SQA documents.

## Porous media incompressible flow capabilities

We added support for solving the porous flow incompressible Navier Stokes equations to the
`navier_stokes` module. These include mass, momentum and energy conservation for the fluid phase.
Some helpful additional kernels for the solid energy conservation equation, such as to handle the
time derivative and the heat convection terms, are also included.

## Proportional Integral Derivative controller

We added a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller to the Control system. This is
helpful for basic tuning / optimization tasks, where some parameters of the simulation have
to evolve to match a target value.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Improvements

- Increased documentation for the Navier Stokes module, and a few MOOSE postprocessors
and auxiliary kernels
