## MOOSE Improvements

### Removing default inclusion of the entire libMesh namespace

The entirety of the `libMesh` namespace is no longer introduced by the `Moose.h` header. This was removed
in order to prevent conflict between namespaces of external libraries that could be used by MOOSE-based
applications.
A reduced number of `libMesh` namespace objects are still included through the `libMeshReducedNamespace.h`.
This list will be adjusted, mostly further reduced, over time.

In order to continue to use `libMesh` namespace objects, we recommend:

- prefacing objects with the namespace name, for example `libMesh::ValueValue` for a `VectorValue`
- in source files, you may add `using namespace libMesh;` in order not to require such prefixes
- in header files, doing so is not generally recommended, the use of prefixes should be preferred

## libMesh-level Changes

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

## Conda Package Changes

- `moose-mpi`, our lowest level package, has been updated to allow users wishing to
  build their own PETSc, libMesh, WASP to do so without needing to install any
  additional Conda packages.
- HDF5 has been downgraded to solve issue: [Floating Point Exception, #28350](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/28350)
- The minimum MacOS build SDK has been bumped to MacOS Big Sur (11.3). Users of
  MacOS versions older than this may run into issues building and running MOOSE, 
  MOOSE dependencies, or other   MOOSE-based applications.
