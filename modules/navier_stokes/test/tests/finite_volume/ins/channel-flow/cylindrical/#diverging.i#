  # transported across the boundary. However, as documented in #16169 we implicitly apply a
  # zero-normal-gradient condition for the pressure at the inlet, and this affects the results in
  # the vicinity. The inlet mass flow rate should be equal to pi, however, the result with the
  # current set of bcs is a little higher than that
