  // Some flow parameters could be nice to have on the component, such as in order the boundary
  // condition specifications, the heat source, etc. You quickly start to want all the parameters of
  // the Physics onto the component, which defeats the purpose of trying to factor out Physics.
  // Instead we should rely on:
  // - junctions to create boundary conditions

  // Having the flow parameters on the component would also undesirably lead to the following:
  // - having nearly a full input file on every flow component
  // - having to create a new component every time we have a new Physics

  // If you want to do that anyway, look at FileMeshWCNSFVFlowComponent
